# Outline

## Summary
1. What the tool is
2. What is its features
3. Quick walk-through of its architecture
4. How can users interact with the tool
5. What is its use case, who can get benefit from it

## Statement of Need
1. Universities prepare computer science courses with different programming languages
2. Static analysis tools are strong tools to assess and teach students on purpose of code quality
3. Not mention the rise of AI generated code quality problems along with the prevalence of AI in the computer science field
4. We built an easy-to-customize static analysis tools to tackle with the detection of the most common 5 code smells in different programming languages
5. It allows professors to build consistent detectors in different languages, introducing united code smell detection experiences for students

## Usage
1. TreeNose is designed to configurable
2. Its utilization of Tree-sitter tokens allows TreeNose to be multi-language
3. Showcase the configuration process of setting up a new language
4. Display how TreeNose can be used into CI/CD build process to automatically 
5. detect assignment results as a static analysis tool
